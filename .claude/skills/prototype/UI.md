# UI Prototype

Generate **several radically different UI variations** on a single sandboxed page, switchable from a floating bottom bar. The user flips between variants in the browser, picks one (or steals bits from each), then throws the rest away.

If the question is about logic/state rather than what something looks like, this is the wrong branch. Use [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md).

## When this is the right shape

- "What should this page look like?"
- "I want to see a few options for this dashboard before committing."
- "Try a different layout for the settings screen."
- Any time the user would otherwise spend a day picking between three vague mockups in their head.

## Where it lives

The prototype is a standalone page inside `<project>/prototypes/<slug>/`, never a route or component in the real app (see [SKILL](SKILL.md) rule 1). Variants render on that one page, gated by a `?variant=` URL search param.

A page in a vacuum hides design problems: every variant looks fine in isolation. Counter that by rebuilding the surroundings inside the sandbox: a stand-in header and sidebar, and realistic sample data at realistic density, so each variant is judged the way it will actually be seen.

## Process

### 1. State the question and pick N

Default to **3 variants**. More than 5 stops being radically different and starts being noise, so cap there.

Write down the plan in one line, in the prototype's location or a top-of-file comment:

> "Three variants of the settings page, switchable via `?variant=`, in `prototypes/settings-layout/`."

This works whether the user is here to push back or not.

### 2. Generate radically different variants

Draft each variant. Hold each one to:

- The page's purpose and the data it has access to.
- The project's component library / styling system (TailwindCSS, shadcn, MUI, plain CSS, whatever).
- A clear exported component name, e.g. `VariantA`, `VariantB`, `VariantC`.

Variants must be **structurally different**: different layout, different information hierarchy, different primary affordance, not just different colours. Three slightly-tweaked card grids isn't a UI prototype, it's wallpaper. If two drafts come out too similar, redo one with explicit "do not use a card grid" guidance.

### 3. Wire them together

Create a single switcher on the prototype page:

```tsx
// pseudo-code, adapt to the project's framework
const variant = searchParams.get('variant') ?? 'A';
return (
  <>
    {variant === 'A' && <VariantA {...data} />}
    {variant === 'B' && <VariantB {...data} />}
    {variant === 'C' && <VariantC {...data} />}
    <PrototypeSwitcher variants={['A','B','C']} current={variant} />
  </>
);
```

Keep the sample data and stand-in surroundings above the switcher; only the rendered subtree changes per variant.

### 4. Build the floating switcher

A small fixed-position bar at the bottom-centre of the screen with three pieces:

- **Left arrow**: cycles to the previous variant (wraps around).
- **Variant label**: shows the current variant key and, if the variant exports a name, that name too. e.g. `B (Sidebar layout)`.
- **Right arrow**: cycles forward (wraps around).

Behaviour:

- Clicking an arrow updates the URL search param (the framework's router if the sandbox uses one, otherwise `history.replaceState`) so the variant is shareable and reload-stable.
- Keyboard: `←` and `→` arrow keys also cycle. Don't intercept arrow keys when an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `[contenteditable]` is focused.
- Visually distinct from the page (e.g. high-contrast pill, subtle shadow) so it's obviously not part of the design being evaluated.
- Hidden in production builds: gate on `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` or an equivalent check, so a stray prototype merge can't ship the bar to users.

Put the switcher in its own file inside the prototype directory.

### 5. Hand it over

Surface the URL (and the `?variant=` keys). The user will flip through whenever they get to it. The interesting feedback is usually **"I want the header from B with the sidebar from C"**, which is the actual design they want.

### 6. Capture the answer

Once a variant has won, capture the answer (which variant and why) the way the [SKILL](SKILL.md) describes. Building the winner into the real app is a CODE-phase PLAN.md task that rebuilds it properly; the variants stay in `prototypes/<slug>/` as reference until the user decides to delete them.

## Anti-patterns

- **Variants that differ only in colour or copy.** That's a tweak, not a prototype. Real variants disagree about structure.
- **Sharing too much code between variants.** A shared `<Header>` is fine; a shared `<Layout>` defeats the point. Each variant should be free to throw out the layout.
- **Wiring variants to real mutations.** Read-only prototypes are fine. If a variant needs to mutate, point it at a stub: the question is "what should this look like", not "does the backend work".
- **Promoting the prototype directly to production.** The variant code was written under prototype constraints (no tests, minimal error handling). Rewrite it properly when you fold it in.
